	<h1>This is my first article</h1>
	<p class="firstParagraph">Dad didn't leave… When he comes back from the store, he's going to wave those pop-tarts right in your face! Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There's a *New* Mexico? Can't you people take the law into your own hands? I mean, we can't be policing the entire city!</p>

	<p>Human contact: the final frontier. The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity… Remember the time he ate my goldfish? And you lied and said I never had goldfish. Then why did I have the bowl, Bart? *Why did I have the bowl? When I held that gun in my hand, I felt a surge of power…like God must feel when he's holding a gun. Duffman can't breathe! OH NO! You don't win friends with salad. Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I work, I work.</p>

	<h1>This is another article</h1>

You know, the one with all the well meaning rules that don't work out in real life, uh, Christianity. Me fail English? That's unpossible. Donuts. Is there anything they can't do? Here's to alcohol, the cause of — and solution to — all life's problems. I've done everything the Bible says — even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff!</p>

	<P>Marge, just about everything's a sin. Y'ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we're not supposed to go to the bathroom.
	I'm normally not a praying man, but if you're up there, please save me, Superman. Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There's a *New* Mexico? Lisa, vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and Eskimos.</P>
