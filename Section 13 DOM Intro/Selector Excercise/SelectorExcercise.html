<h1>Selector Excercise</h1>
<p id="firstP" class="firstParagraph">The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. Happy painting, God bless. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen.</p>

<p>This is unplanned it really just happens. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. You can do it. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose.</p>

<p>Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. Don't fiddle with it all day. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look.</p>

<p>Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. You can get away with a lot. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas.</p>
